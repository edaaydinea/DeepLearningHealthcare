    "### 1. If you are given a dataset of 100 X-ray images, would you still use CNN models? If so, which architecture would you try? And why?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Yes, I would still use a **CNN** model for 100 X-ray images. However, given the relatively small dataset size, I would try **transfer learning** using a pre-trained CNN architecture such as **ResNet-50**, **DenseNet**, or **VGG**. These architectures, pre-trained on large datasets like ImageNet, have learned useful features and can be fine-tuned on smaller datasets. Transfer learning helps prevent overfitting when training with limited data by leveraging learned features from a larger dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. What about if you are given 10,000 images, which CNN models would you try?\n",
    "\n",
    "- For 10,000 images, I would still use **CNN** models, but I might explore more complex architectures like **ResNet** or **InceptionV3** without relying solely on transfer learning. This larger dataset provides more room to train deeper models like **ResNet-50**, **InceptionNet**, or even **EfficientNet**, as it can help in learning more intricate patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Which of the following is NOT true about convolutional neural networks (CNN)?\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) **CNN usually has much more parameters than fully connected neural networks**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is incorrect. CNNs are designed to have fewer parameters than fully connected neural networks because of **local connections** and **weight sharing** mechanisms, making them more efficient in image processing tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Given input sequence = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] and a filter [1, 2, 1], what is the output of the convolution operation with stride 2 and no padding?\n",
    "\n",
    "- The convolution process with stride 2 involves applying the filter on every second element without overlapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "- (1×1 + 2×2 + 3×1) = 1 + 4 + 3 = 8\n",
    "- (3×1 + 4×2 + 5×1) = 3 + 8 + 5 = 16\n",
    "- (5×1 + 6×2) = 5 + 12 = 17\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the output is **[8, 16, 17]**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. What is the size of the output feature map given 6x6 input and two filters of 4x4 with stride 1 and no padding?\n",
    "\n",
    "- The formula for output size is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Output size} = \\left(\\frac{n - f}{\\text{stride}} + 1\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $n = 6$ (input size)\n",
    "- $f = 4$ (filter size)\n",
    "- $\\text{stride} = 1$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Output size} = \\left(\\frac{6 - 4}{1} + 1\\right) = 3\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the output feature map size is **3x3** for each filter. Since there are two filters, the feature map size will be **3x3x2**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. What is the number of parameters for a convolutional layer given a 6x6 input and two filters of 4x4 with stride 1 and no padding?\n",
    "\n",
    "- For each filter, the number of parameters is $4 \\times 4 = 16$. Since there are two filters, the total number of parameters is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "16 \\times 2 = 32\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If bias terms are included, the number of parameters becomes **34** (32 parameters for weights + 2 for biases).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. What is the output of 1D max pooling over input [1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 5] with a filter of size 2 and stride 2?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Max pooling with filter size 2 and stride 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "- Max(1, 2) = 2\n",
    "- Max(3, 2) = 3\n",
    "- Max(3, 5) = 5\n",
    "\n",
    "The output is **[2, 3, 5]**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. What is NOT true about AlexNet?\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) **AlexNet uses larger filters of 11x11 which is computationally more efficient than subsequent CNN models such as VGG and ResNet**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is false. Larger filters are **less** computationally efficient than the smaller filters used in later models like VGG and ResNet, which introduced smaller filter sizes (e.g., 3x3) for better efficiency and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. What is NOT true about CNN architectures?\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) **Inception Net uses 1x1 filters to adjust the output size so that the dimensions across different parallel paths are the same**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is incorrect. Inception Net uses **1x1 filters** for dimensionality reduction, but they do not necessarily ensure the dimensions across different paths are the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. Which of the following is true about CNN models?\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) **CNN can be applied to both images and text data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is true. While CNNs are widely used for image processing, they are also applied to text data for tasks such as text classification and sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11. Why did the CNN model succeed in diabetic retinopathy detection application?\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) **Many labeled images exist**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a key reason for success. The availability of large, labeled datasets enabled CNN models to perform well on the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12. What neural network architecture was used to detect skin cancer in the reference study?\n",
    "\n",
    "The study mentioned, **[44]**, used a **CNN** model for skin cancer detection, particularly based on **Inception V3** trained on dermatological images."
