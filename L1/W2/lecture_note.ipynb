    "Healthcare data emerges from various interactions within the system. Here's a simplified flow of how data is generated and used:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Patient-Provider Interaction**: When patients seek care from providers (e.g., hospitals or clinics), this interaction generates electronic health records (EHRs). These records capture patient information, diagnoses, treatment plans, and outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Medical Claims**: After providing services, hospitals and providers submit medical claims to payers (insurance companies) to get reimbursed for the care provided. This generates another form of data—medical claims data, which includes billing codes and payment details.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Pharmacy Claims**: When patients receive prescriptions, pharmacies process these medications and submit pharmacy claims to insurance companies. This transaction generates pharmacy claims data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Clinical Trials**: Pharmaceutical companies conduct clinical trials to test new drugs or treatments. They collect data on the participants, outcomes, and safety of the drugs. This data is crucial for the drug approval process and is submitted to regulatory agencies like the FDA.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Medical Research and Publications**: Researchers across the healthcare ecosystem analyze the data generated in hospitals, insurance companies, clinical trials, and pharmacies. Their findings are often published as medical literature, contributing to guidelines and best practices in the medical field.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Healthcare Data\n",
    "Different types of data are created and analyzed within this healthcare system:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Electronic Health Record (EHR) Data**: This is patient-level data recorded by providers during healthcare encounters. It includes demographics, medical history, diagnoses, medications, and treatment plans.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Medical Claims Data**: Claims data is generated when providers submit claims to insurers for reimbursement. It typically includes details about procedures, diagnoses, and billing codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Clinical Notes**: These are unstructured text data from doctors and nurses that are part of EHRs. They include observations, medical assessments, and treatment plans that are often key for understanding the patient's condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Medical Literature**: This includes published research papers, clinical guidelines, and reviews. These documents form the foundation of evidence-based practice in medicine.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Continuous Signals**: Data from monitoring devices, especially in critical care settings like the ICU. These signals, such as heart rate or blood pressure readings, are continuously recorded to monitor patient status.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Medical Imaging**: Imaging data includes X-rays, MRI scans, CT scans, and other visual data used for diagnosing and monitoring conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Medical Ontologies**: These are structured knowledge graphs that represent medical concepts and their relationships. Ontologies help standardize terminology and assist in data integration across systems.\n",
    "\n",
